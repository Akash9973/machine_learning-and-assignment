    "In order to reduce overfitting instead of using all the data in training we can provide the subset of data in training the model.This is known as train test split. In train test split we divide the training data into two parts i.e training data and test data. Training data is used to traing our ML model and test data is used for examining wheter the model works accurately or not. Generally it is being consider that in a training dataset 70 % of the data is used for training the model and 30% used for testing.Suppose if a model is in such a way that as the data is increases the result increases or decreases exponentially or not in a linear onder then in this situation we split the data in a method which  is known as cross validaion."
