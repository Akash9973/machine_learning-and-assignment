    "Unsupervised learning in anomaly detection involves using a dataset containing both normal and anomalous instances. After preprocessing the data and selecting relevant features, an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as clustering or density-based algorithms, or autoencoders, is trained on the normal instances. The trained model is then used to assign anomaly scores or labels to unseen instances, and a threshold is established to determine anomalies. The system's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and adjustments are made to the threshold if needed."
